# Abstract

According to literature survey, the document classification is still a challenging problem. The research study initiated with the hypothesis that based on the important features, Entities and Key-Phrases, the news articles can be classified with im-
proved accuracy. It focuses on the feature extraction from news articles and classification.The BBC News dataset is used in the study, which consists of 2225 news articles across five categories. Mainly Entities, Key-Phrases are targeted for the news articles classification. The news features are extracted with AWS Comprehend service. The TF-IDFused as feature weighting method and vectorizer. k-NN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression lbfgs, liblinear, Linear Regression with SGD, Multinomial Nave Bayes classification models are trained with the extracted features and tested with cross validation technique. Based on the results, the study evaluates the classification models and the significance of Entities, Key-phrases in news articles classification.
